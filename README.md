# 🦣 Agile

Agile! Like big, strong mammoth! But you no need big club, you need big, big brain. 🧠

## 🙃 Happy Tribe

We tribe, we strong. Big-big respect for all, no small ones, no weak ones. 💪 Agile, we are. Start tiny, finish much, fast as cheetah 🐆, only best rabbit 🐇 we catch.

We no just throw-shrow spear, we hunt for value. Good-good berry 🍇, yum-yum meat. 🍖 We build, we looky-look, we learn, just like old wisehead, always peeping 👀, always thinking 💡, always growing 🌱.

List of Happy Tribe Ways:

1. Respect all tribe members. 🤗
1. Be fast, finish more. 🏃‍♀️
1. Hunt for value. 🍇
1. Build, look, learn. 🧠
1. Grow always. 🌱

No rushy-rush, no bad-bad, only good-good, only strong-strong. We big like mammoth 🦣, no scary, only helping. Respect all, love Agile way!" 💖

## 🏃‍♀️ RUN-RUN (SCRUM-SCRUM)

Run-run, like dancing around big fire. No one alone, all tribe together. We in circle, we look, we talk, short-short, clear as sky. ☁️

## 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️ Who Do What?
Roles and rocks, very important for tribe. No same, but all needed, like big rock and small rock, both help build strong cave. 🏞️

In tribe, all have role. Like gatherer, hunter, cook, scout. All do job, tribe strong. If no role, if all do same, tribe confused, tribe weak. 😕
